This video goes beyond basic defensive strategies to show how players can put pressure on opponents even when defending. The instructor emphasizes intelligent shot selection, spin control, and tactical variation based on different situations. The content is primarily intended for intermediate to advanced players who are already comfortable with glass play and basic defensive techniques. The extensive practice demonstrations and tactical discussions make this especially valuable for players looking to add more complexity to their defensive game."
