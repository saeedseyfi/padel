    "notes": "An excellent and concise explanation of the 'Four Rooms Method' used by professional tennis players for mental preparation between points. While the video focuses on tennis, the mental techniques are directly applicable to padel and other racket sports. The method provides a structured approach to managing emotions, maintaining focus, and developing tactical awareness between points. The simple four-step visualization process (bathroom to flush away previous points, living room to relax, office to strategize, and hallway to prepare physically) offers players at any level a practical routine to implement immediately."
